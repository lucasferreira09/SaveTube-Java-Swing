### ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to copyright reasons, i won't release the app. I'll just share some screenshots, the project structure and the technologies I used and how it works. Cool?

## ü§î How to use?

#### üîó All you have to do is past the link in the rectangular box next to download image and click in SEARCH.
#### üö´ Please don't use direct playlist links‚Äîthey are not supported. However, if it's a video from a playlist, then it's supported.

#### üëÄ Take a look
![PASTE-LINK](https://github.com/lucasferreira09/SaveTube-Java-Swing/blob/02036f427120fe979e2be07695e98970a9f3545a/screenshots/paste_link_video.png)

##

## üìÇ You can choose the download location too.

##


## ‚åõOnce you have pasted the link and waited a little time. The app will show you the available video options.

## üéµ You can download only the audio, if you want to.

# ü§î How did I make this application?üë®‚Äçüíª

### First of all, I need to get what the Ytdlp returns.
### Then process it, and show only what is necessary to the user, in a cool interface.

## Like thisüëá
![YTDLP-RETURN](https://github.com/lucasferreira09/SaveTube-Java-Swing/blob/b0eb2b8cfca339efce0dd4cb3784325ee7f7d629/screenshots/ytdlp_return_information.png)

## The  <span style="color:red"> **getInformationEachVideo()** </span> method of the DownloaderSystem class takes this function. It retrieves the **title, quality, size, code and thumbnail.**

![DOWNLOADER-SYSTEM-CLASS](https://github.com/lucasferreira09/SaveTube-Java-Swing/blob/b0eb2b8cfca339efce0dd4cb3784325ee7f7d629/screenshots/downloader_system_class.png)

## The <span style="color:red"> **DownloaderSystem** </span> class from the model package is the application's heart. It <span style="color:red"> **handles everything related to processing video and audio data**</span>. Without it, there would be no application.

### All of the information that Ytdlp returns is stored in an ArrayList.
### The line contains the code, quality, size and other irrelevant information. So, I have to extract this for each video option.
### Each video option's quality is added to a HashMap as a key and the value for that key is an ArrayList containing the code and size of the corresponding video option.

> ### For example, suppose this is a line that Ytdlp returns:
> ### <span style="color:red">  -- 323 mp4 1920x1080 00 | 500mb 434k m3u8 | dsds.234434 3245k video_only </span>
> ### I need to extract '323', '1920x1080' and '500mb'

### 
### Then, put it into the HashMap, like this:

> * ### Create an ArrayList and add the code and size ('323' and '500mb').
> * ### Create a HashMap and add the quality as the key ('1080'), and the ArrayList you just created as the value.
#
#
## üñ•Ô∏è Then, the controller's methods will display each video option of this HashMap to the user in a cool interface.
